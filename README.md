# Interactive-Cyber-Security-Stories

## Overview

This project is a JavaFX-based desktop application developed for my final-year dissertation at the University of Southampton. It received a mark of 80%. The tool enables users, particularly educators and trainers, to create and deliver interactive, choice-driven stories designed to improve engagement in cybersecurity education.

## Features

- **Custom Syntax Editor**  
  Write structured stories using a tailored scripting language that supports branching paths, scoring, and conditional logic.

- **Visual Flowchart Interface**  
  Design story logic using a drag-and-drop flowchart builder for a clear, intuitive overview of branching structures.

- **Export Options**  
  Generate story output in:
  - PDF format for print-friendly materials
  - LaTeX format for advanced typesetting or academic integration

- **Custom Parsing Engine**  
  Includes a hand-built parser that validates syntax and ensures reliable story processing.

- **Agile-Inspired Development**  
  Followed an iterative SCRUM-like workflow with weekly milestones and supervisor feedback.

- **Manual Testing**  
  Performed to ensure a smooth and stable user experience.

## Technologies Used

- Java 17  
- JavaFX  
- Scene Builder  
- LaTeX  
- MVC architectural pattern

## Use Case

The tool is designed to help cybersecurity educators create interactive training materials. It can also be adapted for other domains where branching narratives and engagement are valuable, such as language learning, ethics training, or decision-making simulations.
